![preface logo](./src/resources/images/pwa/icon-96x96.png) 

When you receive a friend request on Facebook you have very little
grounds to make a decision on whether to accept it. Unless, of course,
you recognize the inquirer or your're extremely friendly person that
has got 
[capacity to add friends](https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=10151800679568529)
yet.

Preface is a tool supplementing friend requests with intros.
